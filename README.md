# CS599Project

Project Objective: This project’s objective is to develop an executable application that uses holograms in AR space in order to design flight paths for FLS’s and then directly send the flight path to a physical FLS. This is a proof of concept for a scalable application that provides a GUi for users to “drag and drop” drones for flight planning.

The user workflow is as follows:
1. The user draws the flight path on the Windows application on the HL2 with holographic waypoints using a drag-and-drop method 
2. The user presses an AR button that exports the waypoints’ relative X/Y/Z coordinates
3. After some delay for data transfer, the drone begins performing the drawn flight path
